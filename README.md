## Goal

Goal is a project by myself and Luke Conley (https://github.com/grandballoon) while attending Flatiron School's full stack web development bootcamp.

An exercise in creating an app in React, Goal was designed as a task list manager in which users can create goals, break them down into sub-goals, all of which have a due date, and mark them as complete when they are finished.

We also added a drag and drop functionality, in which the user can re-sort a goal's sub-goals, and the order of those goals will persist.
